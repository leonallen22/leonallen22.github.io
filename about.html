<h3>The Site</h3>
<p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a landing page for my own projects as well as provide a little information about myself and my experience. My intention is to make this website simple and accessible with regard to both technical constraints and disabilities. I value simplicity in architecture, design, and code.</p>
